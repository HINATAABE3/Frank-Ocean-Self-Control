  <p>Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah </p>
  <p>About your summer last night</p>
  <p>Ain't give you no play, mmm</p>
  <p>Could I make you shive last night? </p>
  <p>Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?</p>
  <p>Could we make it in? Do we have time?</p>
  <p>I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight</p>
  <p>Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white</p>
  <p>You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life</p>
  <p>Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice</p>
  <p>And our time was right</p>

  <p>Keep a place for me, for me</p>
  <p>I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing</p>
  <p>It's nothing, it's nothing</p>
  <p>Keep a place for me, for me  </p>
  <p>Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry</p>
  <p>Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes</p>
  <p>I came to visage 'cause you see me like a UFO</p>
  <p>That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control</p>
  <p>And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control</p>
  <p>Keep a place for me, for me</p>
  <p>I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing</p>
  <p>Keep a place for me</p>
  <p>It's nothing, it's nothing</p>
  <p>It's nothing, it's nothing</p>

  <p>I, I, I know you got someone comin'</p>
  <p>You're spittin' game, know you got it</p>
